# banking-system-python-mysql
A simulation of a basic banking system project, that uses the mysql.connector module to connect to a local database named "BANK" which includes a table "customer" that stores information about each customer such as their name, national ID, pin, balance, and a record of their operations and uses the ast module to convert string representations of lists stored in the database into Python lists. The Customer class implements basic banking functions such as deposits, withdrawals, and reports, each instance of the Customer class corresponds to a customer in the bank's system and has a unique associated account number. It has a menu for customers to sign in to their existing account or open a new account. The Customer_Management class is responsible for managing the customer's account. It has three methods, sign_on which allows customers to log in by entering their account number and pin, retrieves their account information from a database, and provides options to deposit, withdraw, view account details or log out, open_ account which allows customers to create a new account by entering their name, National ID, and a 4-digit pin. The check_valid_input method is used to validate the input for the name, National ID, and pin and check_valid_input. The code also uses threading locks to synchronize access to the balance and operations of each customer to avoid race conditions and it represented the main-threading file.
